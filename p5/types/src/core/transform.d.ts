         *   pixels along the x-axis and 30 pixels along the
         *   y-axis. The third parameter, z, is optional. It
         *   sets the amount to translate along the positive
         *   z-axis. For example, calling translate(20, 30, 40)
         *   translates the origin 20 pixels along the x-axis,
         *   30 pixels along the y-axis, and 40 pixels along
         *   the z-axis.
         *
         *   The second way to call translate() uses a
         *   p5.Vector object to set the amount of translation.
         *   For example, calling translate(myVector) uses the
         *   x-, y-, and z-components of myVector to set the
         *   amount to translate along the x-, y-, and z-axes.
         *   Doing so is the same as calling
         *   translate(myVector.x, myVector.y, myVector.z).
         *
