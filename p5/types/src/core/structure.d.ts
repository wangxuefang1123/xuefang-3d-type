         *   Creates a new sketch in "instance" mode. All p5.js

         *   methods including pInst.setup(), pInst.draw(),
         *   pInst.circle(), and pInst.fill(). By default,
         *   sketches run in "global mode" to hide some of this
         *   complexity.
         *
         *   In global mode, a default instance of the p5 class
         *   is created automatically. The default p5 instance
         *   searches the web page's source code for
         *   declarations of system functions such as setup(),
         *   draw(), and mousePressed(), then attaches those
         *   functions to itself as methods. Calling a function
         *   such as circle() in global mode actually calls the
         *   default p5 object's pInst.circle() method.
         *
         *   It's often helpful to isolate the code within
         *   sketches from the rest of the code on a web page.
         *   Two common use cases are web pages that use other
         *   JavaScript libraries and web pages with multiple
         *   sketches. "Instance mode" makes it easy to support
         *   both of these scenarios.
         *
         *   Instance mode sketches support the same API as
         *   global mode sketches. They use a function to
         *   bundle, or encapsulate, an entire sketch. The
         *   function containing the sketch is then passed to
         *   the p5() constructor.
         *
         *   The first parameter, sketch, is a function that
         *   contains the sketch. For example, the statement
         *   new p5(mySketch) would create a new instance mode
         *   sketch from a function named mySketch. The
         *   function should have one parameter, p, that's a p5
         *   object.
         *
         *   The second parameter, node, is optional. If a
         *   string is passed, as in new p5(mySketch,
         *   'sketch-one') the new instance mode sketch will
         *   become a child of the HTML element with the id
         *   sketch-one. If an HTML element is passed, as in
         *   new p5(mySketch, myElement), then the new instance
         *   mode sketch will become a child of the Element
         *   object called myElement.
         *   @param sketch function containing the sketch.
         *   @param node ID or reference to the HTML element
         *   that will contain the sketch.
