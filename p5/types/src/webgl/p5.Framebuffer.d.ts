         *   A class to describe a high-performance drawing
         *   surface for textures. Each p5.Framebuffer object
         *   provides a dedicated drawing surface called a
         *   framebuffer. They're similar to p5.Graphics
         *   objects but can run much faster. Performance is
         *   improved because the framebuffer shares the same
         *   WebGL context as the canvas used to create it.
         *
         *   p5.Framebuffer objects have all the drawing
         *   features of the main canvas. Drawing instructions
         *   meant for the framebuffer must be placed between
         *   calls to myBuffer.begin() and myBuffer.end(). The
         *   resulting image can be applied as a texture by
         *   passing the p5.Framebuffer object to the texture()
         *   function, as in texture(myBuffer). It can also be
         *   displayed on the main canvas by passing it to the
         *   image() function, as in image(myBuffer, 0, 0).
         *
         *   Note: createFramebuffer() is the recommended way
         *   to create an instance of this class.
